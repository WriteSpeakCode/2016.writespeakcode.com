          We define "software developer" as anyone who has written a line of code
          (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, Python, Java, whatever) and can explain
          what it does.  Designers, E-book publishers, and beginners as well as
          engineers with 20 years experience have enjoyed our workshops and been
          inspired by each other.
